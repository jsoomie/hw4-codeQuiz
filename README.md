# hw4-codeQuiz

To create a web page quiz app. First the user is introduced to the landing page introducing the user to a brief introduction to the quiz and two buttons that start the quiz or view the highscores. Once the user starts the quiz, it brings up another page like with a a timer and actual quiz in the middle of the page. 

The Quiz random shuffles 6 total questions with 4 possible answer each. Only one answer is correct for each question. If the user chooses correctly, the answer turns green and a correct notification pop up below the quiz area. The same happens for when the user is wrong, but turns red and says incorrect instead. 

If the user chooses wrong, the timer at the top left goes down by 15 seconds. If it reaches 0 or below, the quiz is over. 

Once the quiz is over, the user is met with another screen to record their scores. Then after, it takes the user to the highscore page which the user can view any attempts and scores of the past or can just clear it all to start fresh. 

Then there's a go back button that just takes the user back to the landing page to start over again.
